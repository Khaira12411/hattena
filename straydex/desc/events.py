**WHAT IS A GOLDEN PROMO?**
- It is a Pokemeow event where you are given a chance of getting a  <:Golden11:1147776276510281818> Golden Pokemon in exchange for  <:PokeCoin:1166253401546436648>  1M PokeCoins and 3 promo items.
- Golden Promos require players to unlock the promo by solving a riddle. <@&1151710977193152512> will announce the correct answer to the riddle to make it easier for everyone.
-  Players must add the correct  `Pokemon`  with the correct  `Item`  in a team. Command:  `;t add <pokemon> <position 1-3>`.
- Equip items with this command:  `;t give <item_name> <pokemon>`.
- Once you assembled the correct Pokemon and Items, you can finalize the answer by using the command:  `;t def`. This will set your defending team as your answer to the riddle, and still allow you to set your normal team to battle.
- You can now grind for the promo item with `;p`  `;f`  `;battle`  &  `;egg hatch`.
