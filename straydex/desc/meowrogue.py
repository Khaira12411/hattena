**STARTER TEAM:**
- **Fuecoco**
> Power Moves: `Torch Song` `Shadow Ball` `Blast Burn`
> Status Moves: `Sunny Day`
- **Chimchar**
> Power Moves: `Fire Punch` `Earthquake` `Rock Tomb`
> Status Moves: `Swords Dance`
- **Cyndaquil**
> Power Moves: `Burning Jealousy` `Shadow Ball`
> Status Moves: `Calm Mind`
- **Mudkip**
> Power Moves: `Ice Punch` `Earthquake`
> Status Moves: `Amnesia` `Bulk Up`
- **Charmander**
> Power Moves: `Fire Punch` `Metal Claw` `Solar Beam`
> Status Moves: `Roost`

**IN-GAME ITEMS:**
> - DO NOT get rare-candy. Your enemy level scales off your team's highest pokemon so it's best to not overlevel.
> - Get one exp-share only. Not worth to stack more.
> - Focus on Special items such as Overload, Glutton and Treasure Hunter.
- Prioritise Amulet for more coin gains as you'll need them for rerolling moves.
> - X-items such as X-speed, X-atk/spa/def/spd are all good to get before each Elite round, and Death Challenge. They do make a difference.

**CATCHING**
 > - Just spam the balls you have. Restart the wave if your pokemon is low hp or running low on balls.
 > - You have higher catch rate if enemy is low hp or affected with a status condition but the difference is not worth it.
 > - It's best to catch pokemons in early game where the enemy is also relatively low level. Later in the deep runs, enemies will be overlevelled and they will scale off with your newly caught high level mon.
 > - Every caught mon will be added to your party if it still have available spot. (6 max).
 > - The newly caught mon in team will have random movesets and it will be saved if first time caught. If it is duplicate, the original moveset will remain until you used power-machine or move-machine to change any move.
> - Catch with a full team so the caught mons will just go to your Rogue dex and not into team. This will be helpful as the enemy level will not be affected.

    faq = f"""# MEOWROGUE: FAQ
**Q: What upgrades to focus?**
> - Get Exp-share level 1.
> - Coin-master max.
> - Crutches level 3.
> - Healthy-start max.
> - Shiny-charms max.
**Q: Should I roll for good moveset for starters first or climb more waves first?**
> - Get a decent moveset first with the starters and you can roll them while catching other good battle mons.
**Q: Best way to get good movesets?**
> - Start with the mon you want to change moveset and find the move-machine or power-machine you want. Reroll the free items for these move machines. If you don't see the move you want before the wave 6, stop the run and start over from new wave 1. If you find a move you like, go past wave 6 and stop at around 7 or 8. This is less time consuming and generally easier than going 100+ waves to get a good moveset.
**Q: Best arceus form? **
> - Arceus-Electric. Only weak to ground type moves which can be covered by running with a good flying mon like Gmax Corviknight. Immune to para too. Arc water and arc steel are kinda doable too but a lot more weaknesses.
**Q: Does Shiny or Golden mons deal more damage?**
> - Shiny mons only give +5% luck. Golden mons give +10% luck each and extra stats like how it is in pokemeow. Both shiny and golden varients are considered a separate mon so you could even get different movesets.
**Q: When do I focus on tickets?**
> - Grind for tickets only when you have a good meta pokemon team. Otherwise, prioritise upgrades and getting movesets.
